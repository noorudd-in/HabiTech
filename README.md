# HabiTech

A goal and habit tracker with planner included. Unlock your productivity with the power of technology!

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- `ReactJS`
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `Vite`

## üì¶ Libraries

- `Framer Motion`
- `Axios`
- `DayJS`
- `Recharts`
- `React Hot Toast`

## üö¶ Running the project

To run the project in your local environment, you need to follow the below steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Replace **API_URL** inside `src > constants > index.js` with your API URL. You can also create a dummy JSON file and watch it in a local host and enter that localhost URL here.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn` in the project directory to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `npm run install` or `yarn start` to get the project started.
5. Open http://localhost:5173 (or the address shown in your console) in your web browser to view the app.
6. Enable responsive view and view it in a mobile screen to get better UI experience.

## üß† What New I Learnt?

- Learnt about dayjs library and how can we add, subtract, format, manipulate dates and how to show humanised format of dates and time.
- Learnt how we cannot use `bg-${status ? "green" : "red"}-500` in tailwind css since tailwind cannot parse broken css classes. Instead we need to do like `${status ? "bg-green-500" : "bg-red-500"}`
- How to use onTap, Scale, AnimatePresence, motion from Framer Motion.
- How to manage global store with Context API using useReducer (An alternative experience of Redux).
- How to implement debounce in ReactJS (I though it's same implementation as in JS but no!) to handle multiple requests in a short time.

## üêû Issues

Issues/Bugs which I am not interested to fix due to lack of time or resources.

- It works pretty well on mobile screens but not a great experience in desktop view.
- Theme (Light/Dark) is taken from system's preferences. I am not able to provide user to switch themes as the app's code has grown too big.

## üí° Improvements

- **Calender View**: Display goals, task from the calender point of view.
- **Import**: Allow users to import plans, goals, habits from JSON or Excel Sheet.
- **Export**: Allow users to export plans, habit and goals data.

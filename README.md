# HabiTech

A goal and habit tracker with an integrated planner. Unlock your productivity with the power of technology!

# Demo

The demo of this app is live and is hosted on [habitech.noorudd.in](https://habitech.noorudd.in).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- `ReactJS`
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `Vite`

## üì¶ Libraries & Why I am using it?

- `Framer Motion: For seamless animations`
- `Axios: To handle API calls`
- `DayJS: For Date & Time manipulation`
- `Recharts: For plotting graphs and charts`
- `React Hot Toast: To provide awesome UI notifications (like alerts)`
- `Driver.js: For onboarding user experience`
- `Papaparse: To parse CSV files and convert them to strings, arrays, objects, etc`
- `React-CSV: To generate errorless CSV file from strings and JSON`
- `React-Datepicker: Just like datepicker but with addional functionality`
- `React Router DOM: For page routing`
- `Circular Progressbar: For displaying progressbar as a timer`

## üö¶ Running the project

To run the project in your local environment, follow the below steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Replace **API_URL** inside `src > constants > index.js` with your API URL. Alternatively, create a dummy JSON file and watch it in a local host and enter that localhost URL here.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn` in the project directory to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` or `yarn start` to get the project started.
5. Open http://localhost:5173 (or the address shown in your console) in your web browser to view the app.
6. Enable responsive view and check it in a mobile screen to get better UI experience.

## üß† What New I Learnt?

- Spending a good amount of time on designing the app before writing a code is must.
- How to reduce a good amount of API calls and increase performance.
- Learnt about dayjs library and how can we add, subtract, format, manipulate dates and how to show humanised format of dates and time.
- Learnt how we cannot use `bg-${status ? "green" : "red"}-500` in tailwind css since tailwind cannot parse broken css classes. Instead we need to do like `${status ? "bg-green-500" : "bg-red-500"}`
- Learnt animation techniques like onTap, Scale, AnimatePresence, motion, onDrag from Framer Motion.
- How to manage global store with Context API using useReducer (An alternative solution of Redux).
- Why and how to use debounce/throttling.
- How to work with CVS files, Blob datas, and audio files.

## üêû Issues

Issues/Bugs which I are known and I am not interested to fix due to lack of time or resources.

- It works pretty well on mobile screens but experience in desktop view can be improved.
- Theme (Light/Dark) is taken from system's preferences. I am not able to provide user to switch themes as the app's code has grown too big.

## üí° Improvements

- **Calender View**: Display goals, task from the calender point of view.
- **Detailed Analysis**: Provide detailed analysis with more number of charts and graph options.
- **Format Conversion**: Allow users to convert their habit into goal, goal into habit, habit into plan and more.
- **Pin**: Allow users to pin top three habits or goals or plan if there are too many.
